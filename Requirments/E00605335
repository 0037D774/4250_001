Try to write the requirements for a program that bounces a ball off the sides of the screen and any obstacles larger than 3 pixels the user draws with the mouse
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program shall initialize a two-dimensional space representing the screen area.
The boundaries of the screen shall be treated as solid walls.
Users shall have the ability to draw obstacles within the two-dimensional space using a mouse interface.
Drawn obstacles must be larger than a minimum size (e.g., 3 pixels) to affect the ball's trajectory
Upon collision, the ball shall bounce off the obstacle or boundary, with the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection.
The speed and direction of the ball post-collision shall be calculated based on the collision dynamics.
The program shall provide a real-time visual representation of the ball's motion.
Obstacles shall be rendered in a distinguishable manner from the background and the ball.
