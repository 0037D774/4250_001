	The solution must support missiles launched by the user

1.	The solution must initiate a missile launch when the user clicks the right mouse button.
Precondition: Right mouse button is sticky 
Action: User clicks multiple times and only some clicks go through: 
Postcondition: Only registers valid clicks when clicks are <= 5
Precondition: Right mouse button is not firmly pressed and not registered 
Action: The button input was not picked up
Postcondition: Input was not registered, so missile was not fired

2.	The solution must initiate a missile launch when the user clicks the space bar

Precondition: Right mouse button is sticky 
Action: User clicks multiple times and only some clicks go through: 
Postcondition: Only registers valid clicks when clicks are <= 5

Precondition: space bar button is not firmly pressed and not registered 
Action: The button input was not picked up
Postcondition: Input was not registered, so missile was not fired
 
3.	The solution must limit the number of active missiles on the screen to no more than five (5) at any given time. (an “active missile” is any missile currently being displayed on the screen)
 Precondition: four missiles on the screen and one exploded
Action: Program fails to register the exploded missile has exploded 
Postcondition: User cannot fire missile due to exploded missile counting as an active missile

Precondition: Played the game before and system failed to reboot properly. System failed to reset active missile counter
Action: User tries to fire missile 
Postcondition: User cannot fire missile due to max active missile counter


Precondition: Game crashed and reboot 
Action: User starts the game 
Postcondition: Game has phantom images

4.	The solution must maintain the same constant speed for all missiles
	
Precondition: User has limited memory 
Action: User fires missiles
Postcondition: Image for missile is stuttering

5.	The solution must remove the missile from being active if it goes off the screen

Precondition: Missile does not explode off screen so it doesn’t remove it from active missile
Action: Program fails to de-active missile that went off screen
Postcondition: User cannot fire missile due to reaching max active missiles

Precondition: The user wants to change the monitor or screen size of the game
Action: User moves game on a different monitor or expands screen size
Postcondition: User has trouble seeing game. Game has static borders
