Requirements:
    -Take in a string
    - Can be from the user
      - They can enter any string they would like that is within the ASCII character set.
    - Can be from a file
      - The file can be hard coded in.
      - The string in the file can be anything that is within the ASCII character set.
    - Get the total number of occurances of each character in the ASCII character set.
    - Print out the top 3 characters used in the string.
    - Print out the characters that were not detected.
    - Print out the string in reverse
    - Handle errors that might occur

Design:
    - Take in the string by using Console.ReadLine()
      - User can enter "file" or "user"to choose where to get string from.
    - To get total number of occurances of each character, count each character and keep track with a counter.
      - Then, print out the characters that had the most occurances through previous step.
    - To print out characters that weren't in the string, you should see which ASCII character codes aren't in the string and print it.
    - To print out string in reverse, use a for loop and combine each character for last to first character.
  Unhappy Path:  
  - What if file doesn't exist?
  - What if extended ACSII is used?
  - What if file is locked?
  - What if user enters a non ascii character?
