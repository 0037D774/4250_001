1.	Using Recursion; take two numbers in from the user (a human) and add them together 
    then separate the least significant digit and add it the remaining digits and so on until 
    you have a single digit answer. 

EX: 87345 => 8734+5= 8739 => 873+9 = 882 => 88 + 2 = 90 => 9+0 = 9

Recursion Problem Requirements:
1.	Take user input
  1.1.	Two ints 
  1.2.	Account for non-valid inputs
  1.3.	Account for no input
  1.4.	Allow User to exit program
2.	Add both inputs together
