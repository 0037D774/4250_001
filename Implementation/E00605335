Noah Cole Implementation Assignment
Requirement Analysis:

Design:

Inputs:
1. Add the two numbers together.
2. A string (from a user or file).

Processes:
1. Add the two numbers together.
2. Repeatedly separate the least significant digit from the rest, add it to the remaining digits
until only a single digit remains
3. Complete the total number of occurrences of each character in the ASCII set within the
string.
4. Identify the top three characters with the most occurrences
5. Count how many characters in the ASCII set were not detected in the string.

Output:
1. The single digit result.
2. The top three characters and their design counts
3. The number of undetected ASCII characters
4. The reverse string

Algorithm
1. Initialize a dictionary to count occurrences of each character
2. Loop through each character in the string, incrementing its count in the dictionary
3. Determine the top three most frequent characters
4. Calculate the number of ASCII characters (0-127) not present in the string.
5. Reverse the string.
6. Return the required information

Pseudo Code:
1. Reduce to single digit function:
Function reduce_to_single_digit(num1, num2):
total = num1 + num2
if total < 10:
return total
else:
return reduce_to_single_digit(total // 10, total % 10)

2. Analyze string function:
function analyze_string(input_string):
ascii_counts = initialize an array of 128 zeros
for character in input_string:
ascii_counts[ord(character)] += 1
top_three_characters = get top 3 elements from ascii_counts with their indices
undetected_chars = count zeros in ascii_counts
reversed_string = reverse input_string
return top_three_characters, undetected_chars, reversed_string

Test Cases:
analyze_string("hello world") should return:
Top three characters: ('l', 3), ('o', 2), ('d', 1) (or equivalent based on occurrence)
Undetected ASCII characters: 122 (assuming only letters are counted)
Reversed string: "dlrow olleh"
analyze_string("abcabc123") should return:
Top three characters: ('a', 2), ('b', 2), ('c', 2)
Undetected ASCII characters: 121
Reversed string: "321cbacba"
