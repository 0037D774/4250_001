Requirements:
1. Take in a string file.
2. Take the total number of times each character occurres from the file.
3. Use the ASCII set.
4. Print out the top three chracrters occuring the most from the file.
5. print out the total characters that were not detected in the file.
6. Print out the string file in reverse order.

Design:
- A file is provided with a series of characters in the ASCII set. 
- If the file returns a null value display an error window and close the program.
- If the file is unreadable display an error window and close the program
- The file is then read through by a method and counts the number of occurrences that each character is detected in the file. 
- If the file doesnt contain only ASCII set characters the program will display a error window and close the program. 
- The program must print out only the top three detected characters from most detected to least.
- 

Implementation:
- The program should take in a string file using readalltext method.
