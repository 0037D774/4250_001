Requirements
 
1.	String from User or file
2.	Compute the Total number of occurrences of each character in ACII set
3.	Print top 3 characters with most occurrences
4.	Print out characters that was not detected
5.	Print String in reverse
 
 
 
 
Design
 
Method 1: Ask use would you like to input a string by typing or by file
 
UserInput
•	Ask user to type a string
File
•	Take in file
 
 
Overall 
•	Validate that it is a string
•	If valid STORE 
The .isascii() method in Python does not take any arguments.
 
From <https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/strings/isascii> 
 
A method in python to check for valid ascii characters
•	ELSE do not store and Ask user to input a correct string
 
 
Method 2: Count ACII characters
•	Use stored variable and turn it in into an array
•	Loop into array for each word then character and count each letter
 
•	Print each character with occurrences 
 
Method 3: Print the top 3 occurrences 
•	Sorted characters in by their counts in descending order 
•	Use method 
 sorted_chars = sorted(char_count.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
 
From <https://chat.openai.com/c/a65dd6a1-851a-4c8c-b20a-733838f8bbc6> 
•	Then Iterate through the top 3 characters and print
Method 4
 
for char in input_string: if ord(char) > 127: return True return False
 
From <https://chat.openai.com/c/cc24b8b7-c835-4621-b658-05ff00de1ccf> 
•	Ord checks if it is an ASCII
