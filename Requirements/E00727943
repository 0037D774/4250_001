-	Requirement: Helps with describing what the solution will do.
-	Functional or non-functional and SRS is the formal specifications/needs of a solution. In regards of SDLC phases, the SRS is a precondition for design phase.
-	Analysis, requirements are like goals that should be like SMART. Requirements analysis is how a team understands an action, as much as possible, and the solution.
- Hard to read/understand.. Why? ---> Customers create them and define them.

Try to write the requirements for simple arcade style driving game where the player has to navigate around obstacles to keep from crashing.

Create an objective
- Navigate car through obstacles without colliding with anything / stay on road.

Design Controls
- Use arrow keys for steering
- Add more controls for acceleration.

Define the obstacles
- Introduce various obstacles such as cones, barriers, and moving objects that the player needs to avoid

Creation of Levels
- Design levels introudicng obstacles
- Add tiers to each level to make it difficult 

UI
- Make a friendly interface that is easy to navigate through
- Simple buttons and controls that can be easily understood

Application Used
- Make a decision whether you want to make a mobile app or web version app.

How do you know when you are done with the requirements phase?
When all input meets the requirements or given information on clear documentation that makes sure it matches the overall goals of the provided project.
Check for any expected changes and go over/analyze if the plan works and/or use prototypes to make sure everything is understood and reviewed for the project.
