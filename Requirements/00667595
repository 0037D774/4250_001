- Try to write the requirements for a program that bounces a ball off the sides of the screen and any obstacles larger than 3 pixels the user draws with the mouse.

- Users will draw obstacles by clicking and dragging the mouse on the screen.

- The program must recognize and store the shape of the obstacles drawn by the user.

- Only obstacles larger than 3 pixels shold be considered valid for interaction with the ball.

- The program will simulate a ball that moves across the screen.(position, speed, and direction are predefined but could be randomized or set by the user input in advanced settings)


- If web-based, it should be compatible with major browsers (Chrome, edge, firefox, safari)

- The ball bounces off the screen edges and user-drawn obstacles according to basic physics principles (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection)

- The program must continuously check for collisions between the ball and the screen edges or any user-drawn obstacle.

- Collision detection should account for the size of the ball, ensuring accurate bounce behavior.

- The program should efficiently detect collisions to maintain smooth ball movement, even with multiple obstacles on the screen.

- Assure smooth and responsive ball movement optimized for real-tie interactions

- intuative controls for drawing obstacles

- clear visual feedback should be given for valid and invalid actions

- possibly compatible with standard desktop operating systems Windows, macOS, Linux

- If web-based, it should be compatible with major browsers( Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge )
