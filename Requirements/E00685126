-	Try to write the requirements for simple arcade style driving game where the player has to navigate around obstacles to keep from crashing.

Assuming the game runs on an arcade machine or something similar, the art style is already chosen or will be chosen by an art team.

General  Outline Requirements:
•	Allow input from the player.
•	Have a mechanism to detect collisions with obstacles.
•	Display graphics to the screen.
•	Allow the game to restart when the player loses.
•	A scoreboard to see which players can make it the furthest.
•	Allow the player to pick their car.
•	Allow the player a certain number of lives.
•	The game should be able to generate new obstacles on the fly so that the game can continue (like flappy bird)
•	A system to ensure the player remains in bounds.
•	Allow the car to drift around corners.
•	A mechanism to allow the car to accelerate, decelerate, and handbrake.
•	Multiple themes for the game (Level themes)
•	Switch between car and motorcycle.
•	Allow a ghost trial (let the car race against it’s previous run)


Must:
•	Allow Input from the player:
  o	Accelerate, Decelerate, and handbrake.
  o	Menu navigation.
  o	Pause and Resume game.
•	Detect collisions with obstacles and the outer bounds of the level.
•	Display graphics of the game to a screen.
•	Return the player to the menu when he/she loses.
•	Maintain a score and score board for each player. Allow the player to choose their name for the score.
•	Allow the player a certain number of mistakes/lives in a level.
•	Allow the car to drift around corners with the handbrake.
•	The game should generate new obstacles on the fly (like flappy bird). But be consistent with each level. Like a seed system in Minecraft - Optional
•	The level should increase in difficulty as it progresses (like tiles the mobile game)

Optional:
•	Allow the player to race against their ghost from the previous trial.
•	Have multiple themes for the different levels.
•	Let the player pick between a car or motorcycle.
•	Let the player choose their car and the color of the car.
•	Let each car have different handling attributes.

I think each of these requirements lays out the musts and nice haves of the simple game.
